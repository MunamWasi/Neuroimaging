# Neuroimaging

Neuroimaging is the most interesting frontier in science right now, and is changing at a rapid pace. Improvements in hardware and software, thanks to increased funding, are freeing neuroimaging from the subjectivity of the "expert". Therein lies the controversy, but also the potential

This repository hopes to house techniques, thoughts, and insights, into neuroimaging.
