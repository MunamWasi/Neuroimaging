# Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI)

## Overview:

Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is a relatively novel technique that focuses on the study and analysis of the diffusion of water molecules throughout the brain.

Traditionally speaking, these water molecules are diffused throughout the brain, in many different structures, like the fiber tracts, intercranial membranes, and growth sites etc., among other things. Conventionally speaking, dMRI allows for greater analysis of individual structures and sites in the brain, by analyzing the Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values of the white matter present. 

These numerical insights into the brain illuminates the relationship between present white matter, and the associated brain structures, through connectivity analysis.

The research implications are enormous, and given greater adoption and refinement of techniques, and a greater capability to interpret insights, it is clear that there are many potential clinical applications. Despite being a neuroimaging neophyte, I have seen dMRI being used in cases from executive function analysis in Capital Crime cases all the way to broader bio-behavioral developmental research, schizophrenic hallucination studies, PTSD analysis, Parkinsons' Disease research, and electrostatic burns etc.
